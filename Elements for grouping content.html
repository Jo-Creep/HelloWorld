            <p>This is a paragraph<p> <!-- The paragraph element <p> allows you to define a paragraph of text. 
                                           Most browsers display this element with a line break before and after the contents.-->
            
            <p>This is another paragraph... <br> <!--The break element <br> defines a line break, which will add an empty line on the page. 
                                                     This is useful when you want to add spaces to your content, since HTML will ignore space characters that you type directly.
                                                     <br> is an empty element, which means it doesn't have any contents. Empty elements are written with only a start tag and no end tag. -->
               It has a lot of content...<br>
               Paragraphs can be pretty long</p>
            
            <ol>  <!-- The ordered list element <ol> defines a list of items that have a semantic order. This is typically displayed as a numbered list.-->
                <li>Ready</li> <!-- You can't have a list without list items. The list item element <li> defines content that belongs to a list. 
                                    Use an <li> element within a list element to define each item in the list.-->
                <li>Set</li>
                <li>Go</li>
            </ol>
            
            <hr> <!--The horizontal rule <hr> element defines a paragraph-level thematic break. This is typically displayed as a horizontal rule line on the page.
                     <hr> is also an empty element. -->

            <ul>  <!-- The unordered list element <ul> defines a list of items that have no semantic order. This is typically displayed as a bulleted list.-->
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Bread</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
            </ul>
